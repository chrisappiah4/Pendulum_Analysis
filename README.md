# Pendulum_Analysis
This repository contains a collection of Matlab modules and Solidworks designs to show the analysis of simple dynamic systems known as pendulums. Matlab and Simulink were utilized to compare and contrast results.
Equations and parameters used for the Kapitza Pendulum are found at Ahrazoglu, M. A., Ul Islam, S. A., Goel, A., & Bernstein, D. S. 2023: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10156185. Vibrational Stabilization of the Kapitza Pendulum Using Model Predictive Control with Constrained Base Displacement.
